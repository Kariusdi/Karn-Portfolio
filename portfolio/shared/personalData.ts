        through a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented
        Generation (RAG). It was developed for internal use within my university
        faculty to help students receive accurate, document-based answers. The
        platform features Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions
        across three user roles: User, Admin, and Viewer. Users can chat
        directly with the LLM, with chat history retrieval implemented using
        pagination.`,

Business Understanding
Data Understanding
Data Cleaning
Model Selection
Model Evaluation
The goal was to build a predictive model to classify satisfaction levels and identify key factors influencing passenger experience.

As part of the project, we developed a simple interactive Streamlit app, which was deployed on Hugging Face Spaces, to demonstrate the system‚Äôs functionality. This project was a team effort completed during our 4th-year Data Science course.`,

The main goal is to extract clean, well-structured Markdown (.md) content from these documents, preserving important information while ensuring consistency and usability for downstream LLM applications.`,

To save storage, a binary patch diff strategy is applied, storing only differences from a baseline file. Inspired by DVC, it supports document versioning and traceability.

The system collects live sensor data‚Äîsuch as power, pressure, voltage, force, and punch position‚Äîfrom manufacturing equipment and visualizes it through an interactive dashboard. It also integrates historical data and audio logs to support condition-based monitoring and troubleshooting. I implemented

a real-time data streaming mechanism to receive and push live sensor readings to the dashboard, 
a REST API service to allow querying and interaction with stored machine logs, audio files, and system states, 
a control interface for connecting/disconnecting data streams, clearing logs, and triggering specific machine operations remotely.`,

Monitor machine health in real-time
Review past machine performance
Detect anomalies or warning signs early
Access audio logs for acoustic anomaly detection
Respond to system alerts effectively
The goal of the project was to support a predictive maintenance strategy‚Äîshifting from reactive to proactive machine maintenance, thereby reducing downtime and improving operational efficiency.`,
